  1 Once upon a TIME_OF_DAY dreary, while I PAST_TENSE_VERB, weak and weary,
  2 Over QUANTITY a quaint and curious volume of ADJECTIVE lore—
  3 While I PAST_TENSE_VERB, nearly napping, ADVERB there came a tapping,
  4 As of some one ADVERB rapping, rapping at my ROOM_TYPE door.
  5 "'Tis some NOUN," I muttered, "tapping at my ROOM_TYPE door—
  6 ADVERB this and QUANTITY more."
  7 Ah, ADVERB I remember it was in the ADJECTIVE December;
  8 And each ADJECTIVE dying ember PAST_TENSE_VERB its ghost upon the floor.
  9 Eagerly I PAST_TENSE_VERB the morrow;—vainly I had VERB to borrow
 10 From my books NOUN of sorrow—sorrow for the ADJECTIVE Lenore—
 11 For the rare and ADJECTIVE maiden whom the NOUNS name Lenore—
 12 ADJECTIVE LOCATION for evermore.
 13 And the ADJECTIVE, sad, uncertain rustling of each COLOR curtain
 14 Thrilled me—filled me with ADJECTIVE terrors NUMBER_OF_OCCURANCES felt before;
 15 So that now, to VERB the beating of my BODY_PART, I stood repeating
 16 "'Tis some NOUN entreating entrance at my ROOM_TYPE door—
 17 Some late NOUN entreating entrance at my ROOM_TYPE door;—
 18 This NOUN is and AJECTIVE more."
 19 Presently my BODY_PART grew stronger; VERBING then no longer,
 20 "PERSON," said I, "or PERSON, truly your forgiveness I implore;
 21 But the fact is PERSON was napping, and so ADVERB you came rapping,
 22 And so ADVERB you came tapping, tapping at my ROOM_TYPE door,
 23 That I ADVERB was sure I PAST_TENSE_VERB you" —here I opened wide the door;—
 24 NOUN there and ADVERB more.
